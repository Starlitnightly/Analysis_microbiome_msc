## Abstract

The intricacy and multifaceted nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) necessitate therapies that target multiple aspects of the disease. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) emerge as potential agents to mitigate AD symptoms, however, whether their therapeutic efficacy involves modulation of gut microbiota and the microbiome-gut-brain axis (MGBA) remains unexplored. In this study, we evaluated the effects of three distinct MSC types--derived from the umbilical cord (UCMSC), dental pulp (SHED), and adipose tissue (ADSC)--in an APP/PS1 mouse model of AD. MSC administration resulted in a significant reduction of behavioral disturbances, amyloid plaques, and phosphorylated tau in the hippocampus and frontal cortex, accompanied by an increase in neuronal count and Nissl body density across AD-afflicted brain regions, relative to saline control. Through 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we identified partial restoration of gut microbial balance in AD mice post-MSC treatment, evidenced by the elevation of neuroprotective Akkermansia, and the reduction of AD-associated Sphingomonas. Antibiotic-mediated gut microbiota and targeted bile acids metabolism profiling revealed a significant enhancement in bile acid variety following MSCs therapy. A chief bile acid consitiuent, taurocholic acid (TCA), was orally administered to AD mice and similarly abated AD manifestations. Nonetheless, the disruption of intestinal neuronal integrity with enterotoxin abrogated the ameliorative impact of both MSCs and TCA treatments. Collectively, our findings substantiate that MSCs confer therapeutic benefits in AD within a paradigm that primarily involves regulation of gut microbiota and their metabolites through the MGBA.
